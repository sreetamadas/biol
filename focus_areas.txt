ML



### corrs. data ###  
crystal images, 
crystallographic images, 
protein images(?)
healthcare : X-ray & microscopy data (kaggle)

numeric data (what exactly in this context - vectors of protein sequences?)
disease spread data

text data (protein seq, research papers, patient records)



### application areas ###
crystal detection (image data)
protein crystallization prediction (numeric data)

drug discovery applications
- molecule prediction/detection with required properties , 
- property prediction of selected molecule,
- NLP to select items from reasearch papers (meta-research)

biotech applications
- reaction prediction (?),
- in silico detection of best enzyme variant with required properties

NLP for summarization of research papers - key research in a domain

image processing in other healthcare-related topics
- 


appropriate problems in thematic areas of antibiotic resistance, alzheimer/diabetes/cancer/obesity/TB
