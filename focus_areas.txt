### corrs. data ###  
crystal images, 
crystallographic images, 
protein images(?)

numeric data (what exactly in this context - vectors of protein sequences?)

text data (protein seq, research papers)



### application areas ###
crystal detection (image data)
protein crystallization prediction (numeric data)

drug discovery applications
- molecule prediction/detection with required properties , 
- property prediction of selected molecule,
- NLP to select items from reasearch papers (meta-research)

biotech applications
- reaction prediction (?),
- in silico detection of best enzyme variant with required properties

NLP for summarization of research papers - key research in a domain
