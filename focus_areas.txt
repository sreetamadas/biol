####### skills ####### 
crystallography
proteins
ML


######### corrs. data #########  
crystal images, 
crystallographic images, 
protein images(?)

numeric data (what exactly in this context - vectors of protein sequences?)

text data (protein seq, research papers)


####### application areas ########

appropriate problems in thematic areas of 
- antibiotic resistance,
- alzheimer/diabetes/cancer/obesity/TB/ tropical diseases (dengue, etc)
- disease spread 
- diagnosing early stages of disease

* healthcare problems: data should be easy to acquire/ handle, non-invasive method
image data + genomics + clinical data


image processing in other healthcare-related topics
- X-ray & microscopy data (kaggle)


NLP 
- for summarization of research papers (find key research done in a domain)
- patient records (readmission risk prediction)


function prediction/ annotation
dynamics prediction
structure prediction (address any bottlenecks in X-ray structure determination?)
protein crystallization prediction (numeric data)
crystal detection (image data)


drug discovery applications
- molecule prediction/detection with required properties , 
- property prediction of selected molecule,
- NLP to select items from reasearch papers (meta-research)
- bio-marker development


biotech applications
- reaction prediction (?),
- in silico detection of best enzyme variant with required properties
- protein-protein interaction prediction
- protein design
