### skills ### 
crystallography
proteins
ML



### corrs. data ###  
crystal images, 
crystallographic images, 
protein images(?)

numeric data (what exactly in this context - vectors of protein sequences?)

text data (protein seq, research papers)



### application areas ###
crystal detection (image data)
protein crystallization prediction (numeric data)

drug discovery applications
- molecule prediction/detection with required properties , 
- property prediction of selected molecule,
- NLP to select items from reasearch papers (meta-research)

biotech applications
- reaction prediction (?),
- in silico detection of best enzyme variant with required properties

NLP 
- for summarization of research papers (find key research done in a domain)
- patient records (readmission risk prediction)

image processing in other healthcare-related topics
- X-ray & microscopy data (kaggle)

appropriate problems in thematic areas of 
- antibiotic resistance,
- alzheimer/diabetes/cancer/obesity/TB/ tropical diseases (dengue, etc)
- disease spread
